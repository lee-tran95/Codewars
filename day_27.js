// You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

// For example:

// Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
// Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.

// Let's look at another one.
// You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:
// Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.

// Last one:
// You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}
// At index 0 the left side is {}
// The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}
// They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)
// Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.

// Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.

// Input:
// An integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.

// Output:
// The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.

// Note:
// If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index.

//   Your start-up's BA has told marketing that your website has a large audience in Scandinavia and surrounding countries. Marketing thinks it would be great to welcome visitors to the site in their own language. Luckily you already use an API that detects the user's location, so this is an easy win.

//   The Task
//   Think of a way to store the languages as a database (eg an object). The languages are listed below so you can copy and paste!
//   Write a 'welcome' function that takes a parameter 'language' (always a string), and returns a greeting - if you have it in your database. It should default to English if the language is not in the database, or in the event of an invalid input.
