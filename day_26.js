// The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

// To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

// Input
// Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

// Output
// Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

// Example
// input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
// output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

// Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

// Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

// Examples:

// Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
// Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
// Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
// Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
// Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
// Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
// Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
// Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
// However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.

// Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.

// You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

// The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

// Examples:
// findNb(1071225) --> 45

// findNb(91716553919377) --> -1
